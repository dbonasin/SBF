Title: Nominal Dates, Times, and Durations
Version: 0.1.4
Author: Tim Bergsma
Maintainer: Tim Bergsma <bergsmat@gmail.com>
Description: Provides methods for working with nominal dates, times, and 
 durations. Base R has sophisticated facilities for handling time, but these 
 can give unexpected results if, for example, timezone is not handled properly. 
 This package provides a more casual approach to support cases which 
 do not require rigorous treatment.  It systematically deconstructs the 
 concepts origin and timezone, and de-emphasizes the display of seconds. It 
 also converts among nominal durations such as seconds, hours, days, and weeks.
 See '?datetime' and '?duration' for examples. Adapted from 'metrumrg'
